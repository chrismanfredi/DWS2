      <h4>Early Life</h4>
 
      <p>The Weeknd was born Abel Tesfaye in Scarborough, Ontario,[10] on February 16, 1990.[11] He is of Ethiopian descent.[10] He grew up listening to a variety of music genres, including soul, quiet storm, hip hop, funk, indie rock, and post-punk.[12] Because Tesfaye's father was never around when he was growing up, and his mother was constantly working, his grandma took care of him most of his young life. Because of this, Abel speaks fluent Amharic; it was the first language he learned.[13] Tesfaye says he adopted the stage name, "The Weeknd," after dropping out of high school at the age of 17 and, along with a fellow crew-member, "left one weekend and never came home." The spelling was modified to avoid copyright issues with a Canadian band already named "The Weekend".[14]</p>
 	<h4> Beginnings and mixtapes </h4>
      <p>In Toronto, Tesfaye met producer Jeremy Rose, who had an idea for a dark RB musical project called "The Weekend". After trying to pitch the idea to musician Curtis Santiago, Rose played one of his instrumentals for Tesfaye, who freestyled over it, and they began working on an album. He produced three songs—"What You Need", "Loft Music", and "The Morning"—and others that Tesfaye rapped on, which Rose ultimately scrapped. Rose let Tesfaye keep the tracks he had produced under the condition that he would ultimately be credited for them.[15] However, in December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded "What You Need", "Loft Music", and "The Morning" to YouTube under the name "The Weeknd",[16] though his identity was initially unknown.[17][18] The songs drew attention online through word of mouth, including a blog featuring the songs posted by Toronto-based rapper Drake,[15] who also helped generate interest in the Weeknd.[19] They subsequently received coverage from outlets such as Pitchfork Media and The New York Times.</p>
		<p> On March 21, 2011, Tesfaye released the nine-track mixtape House of Balloons for free through his website.[20] It featured production by Illangelo and Doc McKinney, although it did not credit Rose for his tracks.[15] House of Balloons was met with critical acclaim,[21] and was named as one of ten shortlisted nominees for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.[22]

In July, the Weeknd embarked on a tour and delivered his first performance at the Mod Club in Toronto. The hour-and-a-half long performance created buzz about him.[23] His next performance took place at Toronto’s Molson Canadian Amphitheatre. He collaborated with rapper Drake and appeared as one of the special guests to Drake’s 2nd Annual OVO Fest on July 31, 2011.[24] During the summer, the press noted that the Weeknd refused to participate in interviews and chose to only communicate via Twitter.[25] His second mixtape Thursday was released on August 18, 2011, as a free digital download from the Weeknd's website, and was well received by critics.[26] The Weeknd's third mixtape, titled Echoes of Silence, was released on December 21, 2011.[26][27] Upon this release, the three 2011 mixtapes were collectively known as the Balloons Trilogy,[28] each receiving critical acclaim and growing Tesfaye's fanbase </p>

<h4> 2012–present: Touring and record deal </h4>

<p> In April 2012, the Weeknd began his US tour by performing at the Coachella Festival.[29] He and his band visited various major cities,[29] and culminated in New York, where two sold-out shows were positively reviewed by Rolling Stone.[6] Tesfaye and his tour band continued in major European festivals, including the Primavera Sound Festivals in Spain and Portugal,[30] Wireless Festival in London,[31] plus concerts in Paris and Brussels. At his debut UK show in London, he covered Michael Jackson's "Dirty Diana" in front of an audience which included Katy Perry and Florence Welch.[32] In June, it was reported that the Balloons Trilogy had been downloaded 8 million times and that it would be formally released later in the year.[32]

In September 2012, The Weeknd signed with Republic Records in a joint venture with his own imprint label XO.[33] The compilation album Trilogy was released in November, consisting of remastered versions of the mixtapes and three additional songs.[34][better source needed] It also officially credited Rose as a producer and writer on three songs from House of Balloons.[35] On December 9, the BBC announced that the Weeknd had been nominated for the Sound of 2013 poll.[36]

On May 16, 2013, The Weeknd premiered the title track to his debut studio album Kiss Land,[37] which he said will be released on September 10.[38] It was also promoted by the singles "Belong to the World", "Live For" featuring Drake and The Weeknd's "The Fall" tour beginning in September.[39][40] Kiss Land received generally positive reviews from music critics.[41] The Weeknd also appeared on the soundtrack to The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, contributing "Devil May Cry" and featuring on "Elastic Heart", the second single from the soundtrack.[42][43] In February 2014 The Weeknd remixed the Beyonce single "Drunk In Love." The remix was more of a cover, as The Weeknd tweaked the beat to fit better with his version of the song, that is told through the male perspective. [44]
